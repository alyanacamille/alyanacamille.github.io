 <h4>Project Write Up for “Save the Rocket”
In “Save the Rocket”, a game about guiding a rocket through an asteroid field to a space station. My partner and I had many difficulties with the blocks, such as understanding what blocks to connect with other blocks, as well as the emulator, which seemed to never work. With the help of Google and the MIT App Inventor resource page I was able resolve the problems with the blocks, however I was unable to get the emulator to work unless I was using a tablet. As for whether the development was collaborative or independent, I believe that this project was my “baby”, my partner lacked the integrity to cooperate, add his own ideas, or simply work on it. Instead of actually working with me on blocks and design, he would “work on it at home” or play games with other students. With that being said, I created all design and logo aspects and well as the concept for the game (which is an opportunity for me because I love design), and I did the majority of the blocks. I might have been a bit condescending on my partner however, he obviously did not care about this project.
