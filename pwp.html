<h1>project write-up</h1>
<h2>There were many opportunities to grow in this project, I was able to work efficiently and communicate with my partner. As well as create a interesting story, as for my this project was very easy and fun. A diffictly that my partner and I accounted was that we had trouble coming up with a story however we eventually met at a compromise. Also we found that getting the program to restart after you died to be difficult, however we soon realized that is was simply like the other calls that we created earlier. This project was very collaborative when it came to working on ideas and commenting and we were able to both learn by creating our own versions of interactive fiction.
